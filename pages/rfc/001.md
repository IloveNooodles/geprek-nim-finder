### Summary

This RFC documents how the offline search is implemented.
The offline search is implemented for efficiency in multiple devices.
Remembering the amount of students and the offline search is going to be run on browsers, the search algorithm should utilise as little resource as possible.

### Scoring Algorithm

For different types of input, this algorithm scores them differently.
With scores for each student calculated, the students data can be sorted accordingly.
There exists three types of inputs:

1. Alphabetical input (for names and major)
2. Numerical input (for NIMs)
3. Alphanumerical input (for identifying major)

#### Alphabetical Inputs

For alphabetical inputs, below are explained how the scoring is done to a student:

1. Tokenize student name, split by spaces
2. Instatiate variable `factor=1` to make matches with first names are prioritized.
3. For each tokenized name:
   1. If keyword matched with beginning of tokenized name, add score with `3*factor`
   2. if keyword matched with end of tokenized name, add score with `2*factor`
   3. Replace variable `factor` with `0.9*factor`

#### Numerical Inputs

For numerical inputs, below are explained how the scoring is done to a student:

1. Instatiate variable `factor=1` to make matches with first names are prioritized.
2. For each tokenized name:
   1. If keyword matched with beginning of tokenized name, add score with `3*factor`
   2. if keyword matched with end of tokenized name, add score with `2*factor`
   3. Replace variable `factor` with `0.9*factor`
